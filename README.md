#OIP

## About

OIP is a visualization in which individual machine IPs are placed randomly on a display, and packets are visualized as different sized dots flowing from one machine to another.

### Architecture

OIP is primarily a server/client architecture. The server analyzes traffic on a given port, and streams summaries to clients over a udp session. The packets are encrypted using a shared AES key. The server should have two interfaces. One of them should be connected to a mirror interface, and the other should be used for the client connections.

The client can also be used as a stand-alone app by reading pcap files.

## Introduction

This is an update and modification of the forked OIP project from /eldraco on https://github.com/eldraco/oip to run on OS X Mountain Lion.

Original source code on: https://it.wiki.usu.edu/OIP

## How-To

### Command line

#### Parameters

1. -e argument to speed up the analysis of pcap files:

1.1) `-e 1000` is normal
1.2) `-e 100` is 10x faster
1.3) `-e 10` is 100x faster

2. -c argument to give the pcap file name in the command line:
2.1) If you give a pcap file name, the analysis starts right away.

3. Pause/Play the capture by pressing the letter p.

#### Color code:

##### On packet-balls:
1) Red for UDP
2) Green for TCP
3) White for ICMP

##### On hosts:
1) Unknown still

### GUI

You can use the mouse and the keyboard.

Keyboard keys:
1. `!` to open the menu
2. `,` to start displaying the capture (Load button).
3. `p` to pause and play the capture


## Installation
